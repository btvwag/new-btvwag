Please join us on Feb 22nd, 2011 from 6 - 8 pm at
[Three West Collective](http://www.threewestcollective.com/#about) for presentation
and discussion on the Agile Process.

The Agile software development process is a set of guidelines and best
practices around evolving applications iteratively. It encourages working in fast
development cycles focused on communication around and implementation of individual
component features. At the forefront, Agile encourages that the "Working
Product is King" and that at the end of each iteration, you have a functioning
product that has addressed the most important issues that faced your client at
the start of the iteration.

We will cover the basic guiding principles around Agile, and how best to adapt
those principles into your day to day process. We will have an open discussion
with groups that have already adapted Agile into their teams, and how it has
transformed their end products. We will also cover many of the fringe benefits
of working in an Agile environment, including improved Version Control
management and Release management.

[Nowell Strite](http://nowell.strite.org/) is the Senior Manager of Technology
Solutions at [PBS Education](http://www.pbs.org/) and has been a Web architect
for over 15 years. He was responsible for bringing the Agile process to PBS
Education and for ensuring that the "working product remains king".
