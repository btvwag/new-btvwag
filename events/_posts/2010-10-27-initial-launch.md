I attended my first BTVWAG meetup in Burlington today, where @bseanvt presented
to a group of about 15 web technology enthusiasts about Rails and Hadoop. After
his presentation, we started a discussion about the future format and content
of BTVWAG meetings. I was really excited by several of the potential future
formats, including: bring your problems from work days, lightning talks,
solving the same problem with different technologies, and regular old
presentations. I think that this varied format will provide a great atmosphere
and rich enough content to bring people in, and keep them coming back.

After leaving the meeting, I decided to take an initial stab at getting
a website up and running as well as getting the group setup on GitHub. After
setting up the GitHub account, I remembered that GitHub provides free site
hosting using their built in Jekyll static site generator. If you would like to
pitch in to develop a better website, please read up on the 
[Jekyll Documentation](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.textile)
and then run the following command to clone this website, and start
contributing.

git clone http://github.com/btvwag/btvwag.github.com.git
